// Minimal d3dkmthk.h for builds without the Windows Driver Kit.
//
// MochizukiNrRuntime.cpp needs exactly three user-mode entries from this header - D3DKMTOpenAdapterFromLuid,
// D3DKMTQueryVideoMemoryInfo and D3DKMTCloseAdapter - and the two structs and one enum they take. The real
// header ships with the WDK, not with the Windows SDK: a WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN user-mode translation unit that
// includes <windows.h> and <d3d12.h> gets D3DKMT_HANDLE from d3dukmdt.h but not the thunks, so a machine with
// only the MSVC build tools and the SDK cannot compile the VRAM check (error C1083: d3dkmthk.h).
//
// Same idea as the dirent.h next to it: the file MSVC has no equivalent of, only what this product uses.
// Field order, types and enum values are the public definitions (_D3DKMT_QUERYVIDEOMEMORYINFO,
// _D3DKMT_OPENADAPTERFROMLUID and D3DKMT_MEMORY_SEGMENT_GROUP); nothing here is private to a driver build.
// Windows has no ABI fallback for these: the adapter handle and the query result cross into gdi32.dll, whose
// exports are the same ones DXGI's QueryVideoMemoryInfo uses.
//
// Builds that do have the WDK keep using it: MochizukiNrRuntime.cpp includes this file only after
// __has_include(<d3dkmthk.h>) has failed.

// d3dukmdt.h is not included: it refuses direct inclusion (#error unless d3dkmthk.h/d3dkmdt.h is the includer).
